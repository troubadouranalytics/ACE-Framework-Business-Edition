        <h2>Why AI Analysis is Transforming Business</h2>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h3>✅ Unprecedented Analytical Power</h3>
            <p>AI can process vast amounts of information, identify patterns across multiple data sources, and provide 24/7 analytical support for complex business decisions. It offers objective analysis free from personal biases, office politics, and emotional decision-making that can cloud human judgment.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">But Current AI Has Critical Limitations</h2>
        
        <div class="problem-box">
            <h3>❌ Analytical Blind Spots</h3>
            <p>Current AI systems often default to "both sides" analysis even when evidence clearly supports one conclusion. They get caught up in conventional business wisdom rather than examining actual performance data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="problem-box">
            <h3>❌ Academic Over Practical</h3>
            <p>AI tends toward theoretical balance and abstract frameworks instead of focusing on real-world outcomes and measurable results that matter to your business.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="solution-box">
            <h3>✅ The ACE Advantage</h3>
            <p>Our framework redirects AI toward evidence-first analysis, emphasizing practical results over conventional assumptions. It also provides a structured protocol for conducting further investigations. Get clear, actionable insights based on what actually works, not what sounds good in theory.</p>

        <div class="investigation-summary">
            <p>AI often provides generic advice and suggests you "consult professionals." The ACE Framework prompts AI to follow the systematic Investigation and Knowledge Review Protocol - a comprehensive analytical methodology for your business needs.</p>

        <div class="advantages-list">
            <h3>Seven-Domain Knowledge Assessment System:</h3>
            <p>AI is prompted to identify specialized knowledge: <strong>Technical/Engineering Expertise</strong> (product specs, manufacturing processes, technical feasibility), <strong>Legal/Regulatory Knowledge</strong> (compliance requirements, regulatory changes, legal precedents), <strong>Industry-Specific Intelligence</strong> (sector trends, competitive dynamics, market conditions), <strong>Financial/Accounting Analysis</strong> (cost structures, revenue models, financial implications), <strong>Historical Context</strong> (past implementations, case studies, precedent analysis), <strong>Geographic/Regional Factors</strong> (location-specific conditions, regional variations), and <strong>Operational Requirements</strong> (implementation challenges, resource needs, timeline considerations).</p>
            
            <h3>Six Research Methodologies Integration:</h3>
            <p>AI is prompted to present further research directions: <strong>Academic Research Review</strong> (scholarly studies, peer-reviewed analysis), <strong>Industry Case Studies</strong> (comparable implementations, success/failure examples), <strong>Alternative Methodological Approaches</strong> (competing analytical frameworks), <strong>Comparative Analysis</strong> (benchmarking against similar situations), <strong>Expert Opinion Integration</strong> (subject matter expertise, specialist knowledge), and <strong>Evidence Contradiction Search</strong> (information that challenges conclusions, alternative interpretations).</p>

            <h3>Four Primary Evidence-First Questions:</h3>
            <p>AI is prompted to focus on measurable outcomes: <strong>What are the actual results?</strong> (measurable outcomes rather than intended goals), <strong>Who benefits and who bears costs?</strong> (concrete effects on different parties), <strong>What does the evidence show?</strong> (data, historical comparisons, practical outcomes), and <strong>What works in practice?</strong> (comparing theoretical claims with real-world performance).</p>
            
            <h3>Four Common Analytical Traps Eliminated:</h3>
            <p>AI is trained to avoid standard business justifications: <strong>"Market forces justify current arrangements"</strong> (examine whether arrangements actually produce good outcomes), <strong>"There are valid arguments on both sides"</strong> (when evidence is clear, acknowledge it rather than false balance), <strong>"Industry standards justify these practices"</strong> (examine whether standard practices actually produce good results), and <strong>"Complex factors make assessment difficult"</strong> (often used to avoid examining straightforward evidence).</p>
